If you search for OS X keyboard shortcuts you get lots of pages, and none list everything, few are up to date, and few prioritize them well.

Please help make this list more helpful, easier to use, or more complete!

[File PRs](https://github.com/open-guides/og-osx-shortcuts/pulls) with improvements.
Try to keep them focused, with different issues for different changes.
If you don't have time or are unsure how to write it, or it's a general suggestion or a question, just
[file an issue](https://github.com/open-guides/og-osx-shortcuts/issues) instead.
